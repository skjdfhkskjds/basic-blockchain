# basic-blockchain
This is a simple blockchain model written in JavaScript which uses SHA256 encryption to create hashes for blocks and transactions.

The blockchain module contains three classes: Transaction, Block, and Blockchain. These classes are used to define the structure and functionality of the blockchain.

The keygeneration module generates new public and private key pairs to serve as wallet addresses to interact with other wallets on this blockchain.

The main module is used as a testing module and hosts the entire blockchain.
