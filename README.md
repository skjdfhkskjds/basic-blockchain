# Blockchain with React Frontend

The blockchain logic runs on a module containing three classes: Transaction, Block, and Blockchain. These classes are used to define the structure and functionality of the blockchain. The keygeneration module generates new public and private key pairs to serve as wallet addresses to interact with other wallets on this blockchain.

The blockchain frontend was written with React, and allows you to upload transactions onto the blockchain and will show you any transactions that you upload including its hash value.
